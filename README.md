## 📖 About The Project

**Omega LIS** is a lightweight, standalone medical laboratory system designed to demonstrate the power of mobile edge computing. Created during a "New Year's Coding Challenge" (Jan 1, 2026), this project proves that enterprise-grade logic—including IoT simulation, PDF reporting, and triage algorithms—can be deployed without cloud infrastructure, using just a Python environment on a mobile device.

**Key Architecture:**
* **Server:** An Android smartphone running Python (Flask) acts as the Intranet Server.
* **Client:** Tablets/Laptops connect via local Hotspot to access the Doctor's Dashboard.
* **IoT Layer:** Background threads simulate biochemistry analyzers sending HL7-like data.

## 🚀 Features

* **🔐 Secure Access:** Session-based authentication system.
* **⚙️ IoT Simulator:** Built-in multi-threaded engine simulating medical analyzers (Cobas/Roche style) generating real-time results for parameters like GLU, TSH, K.
* **🚑 Triage Engine:** Automatic validation logic detecting Critical Values (`PANIC`) and marking them for immediate review.
* **📸 Mobile Scanning:** Utilizes the smartphone camera and JS BarcodeDetector to scan patient sample IDs directly into the system.
* **📄 PDF Reporting:** On-the-fly generation of official, printable medical reports using `fpdf`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.11
* **Web Framework:** Flask
* **Database:** SQLite3 (Zero-config)
* **Reporting:** FPDF
* **Concurrency:** Python `threading` module
* **Environment:** Pydroid 3 / Termux

    * **Login:** `admin`
    * **Password:** `omega`

## 👨‍💻 The Story

This system was coded from scratch on a smartphone during a New Year's Day coding session. The goal was to challenge the notion that "you need a powerful laptop to build software." It handles database transactions, PDF generation, and async simulation concurrently on a mobile processor.

## 📜 Development Journey

Since this project was built iteratively on a mobile device without a standard Git workflow, I have preserved the development stages in the [`archive/`](./archive) folder.

You can trace the evolution of the code here:
* `v1_standalone_simulator.py` - Initial logic for the biochemistry analyzer (CLI only).
* `v2_basic_flask_app.py` - First implementation of the Web Interface.
* `v3_integration_pdf.py` - Adding FPDF library for reporting.
* `main.py` - **Final Version** (Current Release).


## 🤖 Acknowledgments & AI Collaboration

This project was built with the assistance of **Custom Google Gemini Gems**.
Acting as a specialized virtual team (Database Architect, Python Senior Dev, Security Officer), these AI agents provided critical support during complex debugging sessions and logic implementation.

> *Special thanks to the Gems for maintaining context when the human developer's RAM was low due to New Year's Eve festivities.* 😉
